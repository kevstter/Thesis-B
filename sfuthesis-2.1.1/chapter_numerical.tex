\chapter{Numerical Experiments}
\label{chap:num experiments}
This chapter is entirely devoted to solving stiff PDEs prevalent in a number of fields. The experiments we demonstrate will fall under three categories: image inpainting, interface motion, and phase separation. For each problem, we will give the PDE model and then discuss how we stabilize and select the parameters. Our experiments will show the feasibility of these schemes in 2D and 3D. 

Before proceeding further, we would like to make a few notes on our implementation of these schemes. As stated from the outset, our goal is to provide simple, accurate, and efficient time stepping methods for nonlinear PDEs. Too often, new efficient methods are sufficiently complicated that users resort to simple explicit schemes that require lengthy computing time rather than invest an indeterminate amount of time understanding, implementing, and debugging.

In our implementation, the choice of $p$ is fixed throughout the time evolution. Alternately, one may want to adapt $p$ as the solution evolves to avoid overestimates of $p$ that could lead to larger errors. However, we do not pursue this here. So while our theory speaks of approximating the eigenvalues of the linearized system, we do not incur this cost in our computations. 

Note that a static value of $p$ offers the advantage that the linear system to be solved is the same at each time step, i.e.\ the matrix to be inverted is static. Any expensive preprocessing/factorizing of this matrix needs only be done once.

\section{Image Inpainting}
Image inpainting is the task of repairing corrupted images and damaged artwork \cite{bertalmio2000image}. In the inpainting examples to follow, the user identifies in the image the region to be inpainted, and from there, a PDE model is evolved to fill-in the inpainting region using the neighbouring information.

Two PDE models are selected. The first is a second order model from Shen and Chan \cite{shen2002mathematical}, and the second is a recent fourth order model from Sch{\"o}nlieb and Bertozzi \cite{schonlieb2011unconditionally},
\begin{align}
        u_t  = \nabla \cdot \left(\frac{\nabla u}{\sqrt{\abs{\nabla u}^2 + \epsilon^2}} \right) 
+ \lambda_D(u_0 - u), 
\label{bv inpaint}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
         u_t  = -\Delta \nabla \cdot \left(\frac{\nabla u}{\sqrt{\abs{\nabla u}^2 + \epsilon^2}} \right) 
+ \lambda_D(u_0 - u).
\label{tvhneg inpaint}
\end{align}
We refer to these as TV inpainting and TV-H$^{-1}$ inpainting.

The solution, $u$, is the inpainted image we seek. The quantity, $u_0$, is the initially corrupted image, and $\epsilon > 0$ is a regularization parameter. Denoting the image domain $\Omega$, and the inpainting region, $D$, we then define $\lambda_D$ as 
\begin{align}
\lambda_D(x)
= \begin{cases}
\lambda_0, & x\in \Omega\setminus D
\\
0, &\text{otherwise},
\end{cases}
\end{align}
for some $\lambda_0 > 0$.

As for initial conditions, we have two vandalized images to be restored. The first is \cref{fig:turtle with text} where we have overwritten with text a photograph of a sea turtle. We would like to restore the photograph by removing the text. The second is \cref{fig:bullfinch and fox}, where the fox figure requires removal. Although this may look simpler, it is in fact a more challenging scenario because the thickness of the inpainting region requires correctly extending level lines over long distances \cite{schonlieb2011unconditionally}.

The image is restored in a channel-by-channel manner. As a stopping criteria, we look at the difference in successive images, 
\begin{align}
        \frac{\norm{u^{n+1} - u^n}_2}{\norm{u^{n+1}}_2} < \mathrm{tol},
\end{align}
where the tolerance is set at $\mathrm{tol}=\num{9e-5}$.  In addition, we also set a maximum of 500 iterations per channel. We report the time step-size and the total number of iterations used for each scheme.

Finally, we note that the spatial discretization is by second order centred differences with uniform spacing, $h$, in both $x$ and $y$.

\end{figure}

\subsection{TV inpainting}
We first show that the TV inpainting model can easily be handled by our methods. In this model, there are two terms on the right-hand side, both potentially stiff.  The second term is stabilized by adding and subtracting $-p_0\lambda_0 u$, where $p_0$ is the minimum value required for unconditional stability from applying the time stepping method to the modified test equation. For the first term, we stabilize by adding and subtracting $p_1\Delta u$. To determined $p_1$, we bound the first term as 
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
        \nabla \cdot \left(\frac{\nabla u}{\sqrt{\abs{\nabla u}^2 + \epsilon^2}} \right) 
&= \frac{u_{xx}(u_y^2 + \epsilon^2) + u_{yy}(u_x^2 + \epsilon^2)}{(u_x^2 + u_y^2 + \epsilon^2)^{3/2}} 
- \frac{2u_xu_y u_{xy}}{(u_x^2 + u_y^2 + \epsilon^2)^{3/2}} 
\\
&\leq \frac{(u_{xx}+u_{yy})(u_x^2 + u_y^2 + \epsilon^2)}{(u_x^2 + u_y^2 + \epsilon^2)^{3/2}} + \frac{(u_x^2 + u_y^2 + \epsilon^2)u_{xy}}{(u_x^2 + u_y^2 + \epsilon^2)^{3/2}}  
\\
&= \frac{u_{xx} + u_{yy} + u_{xy}}{\sqrt{u_x^2 + u_y^2 + \epsilon^2}}.
\end{split}
\label{p1 estimate inpaint 1}
\end{align}
We then consider the auxiliary equation $u_t = u_{xx} + u_{yy} + u_{xy}$ discretized by centred differences in space and forward Euler in time and apply a von Neumann analysis with $u^n_{jk} = \xi^n \exp(i\omega_1jh)\exp(i\omega_2kh)$ to get 
\begin{align}
        \frac{\xi  - 1}{\Delta t} 
= \frac{1}{h^2}(-4 + 2\cos(\omega_1 h) + 2\cos(\omega_2 h) - \sin(\omega_1 h)\sin(\omega_2h))
\geq -\frac{8}{h^2}.
\label{p1 estimate inpaint 2}
\end{align}
Combined with the assumption of the extreme case, $\sqrt{u_x^2 + u_y^2 + \epsilon^2} \geq \epsilon$, we set $p_1$ according to 
\begin{align}
        p_1\frac{8/h^2}{8/(\epsilon h^2)} \geq p_0 \iff 
p_1 \geq \frac{1}{\epsilon}p_0.
\end{align}

The images restored by TV inpainting and SBDF1, SBDF2, and CNAB are shown in \cref{fig:bv inpainting}. Parameters were set as $\epsilon=0.10$ and $\lambda_0=20$. \cref{tab:bv iter counts} provides the iteration count required with each method. We observe lower iteration counts and better efficiency with second order methods.

\subsection{TV-H\texorpdfstring{$^{-1}$}{-1} inpainting}
For TV-H$^{-1}$ inpainting, we stabilize \cref{tvhneg inpaint} using
\begin{align}
        u_t = -\Delta \nabla \cdot \left(\frac{\nabla u}{\sqrt{\abs{\nabla u}^2 + \epsilon^2}} \right) + \lambda_D(u_0 - u)  + p_1\Delta^2 u + p_0\lambda_0 u - p_1\Delta^2 u - p_0\lambda_0 u.
\label{tvhneg stabilized}
\end{align}
We note $p_0$ is chosen exactly as in TV inpainting. Determination of $p_1$ applies the bound set in \cref{p1 estimate inpaint 1,p1 estimate inpaint 2} to get 
\begin{align}
        p_1\frac{(8/h^2)^2}{(8/h^2)(8/(\epsilon h^2))} \geq p_0 
\iff p_1 \geq \frac{1}{\epsilon}p_0,
\end{align}
which is also the same as TV inpainting.

Interestingly, in the same paper where they propose \cref{tvhneg inpaint} for image inpainting, the authors offer exactly \cref{tvhneg stabilized} and time stepping with SBDF1 as the solution algorithm. In \cref{tab:bvhneg iter counts}, we chart again the iteration counts required for each of SBDF1, SBDF2, CNAB, with parameters $\epsilon=0.10$ and $\lambda_0=30$. Once again, the second order methods are an improvement over the first order method, with the improvement especially notable in the more difficult example with the bullfinch. 

As a final note, we mention other interesting developments \cite{bredies2010total,papafitsoros2014combined,papafitsoros2013combined}. In these papers, a number of image restoration models have been proposed involving high order derivatives interacting nonlinearly. It would be of interest to compare the effectiveness of our schemes with the methods proposed in these papers.

\section{Motion by Mean Curvature}
In this section, we study the problem of interface evolution under mean curvature flow. The level set equation for motion by mean curvature is 
\begin{align}
        u_t 
= \kappa\abs{\nabla u} 
= \abs{\nabla u} \nabla \cdot \left(\frac{\nabla u}{\abs{\nabla u}} \right).
\label{mcm}
\end{align}
Our interest is in the time evolution of the interface, $\Gamma=\Gamma(t)$, described by the zero level set of the function $u$,
\begin{align}
        \Gamma(t) = \{x \in \bR^d \mid u(x,t) =0\}.
\end{align}

We will demonstrate the effectiveness of our schemes on examples similar to that of Smereka \cite{smereka2003semi}. In \cite{smereka2003semi}, he uses what we call linearly stabilized SBDF1 to take large, stable time steps. Further, in the same paper, it was also suggested that Richardson extrapolation may be used to attain second order convergence, but was not implemented. We follow the example set in \cite{smereka2003semi} and stabilize \cref{mcm} with a Laplacian term, $p\Delta u$, to get 
\begin{align}
        u_t = \kappa \abs{\nabla u} - p\Delta u + p\Delta u.
\end{align}
An analysis similar to \cref{p1 estimate inpaint 1,p1 estimate inpaint 2} yields $p\geq p_0$ to be sufficient for unconditional stability.

Let us point out a key difference between this problem and the inpainting problem of the previous section. In the inpainting problem, the system was to be driven to steady state. As such, we were afforded a range of time step-sizes where the solution method was computationally efficient. Indeed, the step-size did not affect the visual quality. For mean curvature flow, computing time and accuracy are directly related to the choice of step-size. Thus we are interested in large step-sizes only if an acceptable level of accuracy is maintained.

\subsection{Shrinking dumbbell in 2D and 3D}
Our first example is the evolution of a dumbbell-shaped curve in 2D. \cref{fig:mcm 2d dumbbell} plots the motion of this curve under mean curvature flow. From the initial dumbbell shape, the corners smooth out and then the curve shrinks as shown, until it eventually collapses down to a point. These reference solutions were generated to time $T=1.25$ with an explicit Runge-Kutta method and a small time step-size. On a periodic grid of size $256\times 512$ and approximating the spatial derivatives using second order centred differences, the number of time steps needed for stability is $\O(10^4)$.

\label{fig:mcm 2d dumbbell}
\end{figure}

In \cref{fig:mcm 2d conv}, we show the convergence of SBDF1, SBDF2, CNAB, EIN, ETDRK2, ETDRK4 for the same problem, but plotting in the positive quadrant only. As shown, each scheme is stable and convergent using much fewer than $10^4$ time steps. However, it is important to note that amongst the schemes, the number of time steps needed to achieve an acceptable level of accuracy ranges from 50 to 800.

Within each plot, each curve is the solution using the number of time steps, $n$, as indicated.}
\label{fig:mcm 2d conv}
\end{figure}

The most disappointing of these is CNAB, for which a minimum of 400 time steps was needed to get a solution profile that fits within the frame we have chosen. Furthermore, it needs close to 800 time steps to present a solution competitive with the other methods in accuracy. SBDF2 likewise fared poorly in that regards, needing close to 800 time steps for a solution competitive with the other methods in accuracy. 

We now take a more careful look at the ETDRK schemes and the EIN method. Recall that these are the schemes that have strong damping at infinity (see \cref{fig:damp fac at inf etd}). Zoom-ins to the solution by these methods are presented in \cref{fig:mcm zoom in 1,fig:mcm zoom in 2}. These show that the ETDRK schemes offer good accuracy and convergence using just 50 time steps. The EIN method, however, is again hampered by slow convergence. This is especially clear in \cref{fig:mcm zoom in 1}. If we further factor in computing time, then both CNAB and SBDF2 outperform the EIN method.

\label{fig:mcm zoom in 2}
\end{figure}

Next, we take this example into 3D. Here, the advantages of our schemes are further magnified. In 2D, one could argue that the computations can be completed using standard explicit schemes within reasonable computing times. In 3D, doing so may require trade offs in the grid size, or computing only over short time periods. 

Setting the initial condition to be the dumbbell-shaped curve of the top left image in \cref{fig:mcm 3d dumbbell}, the curve is then evolved by mean curvature flow. We use a periodic grid of size $256\times 128\times 128$ and solve to time $T=0.75$. With forward Euler, we needed $3000$ time steps for stability, which corresponds to over 28 minutes in \textsc{Matlab} 2014b on an Intel\textsuperscript{\textregistered}Core\textsuperscript{\texttrademark}i5-4570 CPU@3.20GHz workstation running Linux. With the linearly stabilized ETDRK2, we solved the same problem using 75 time steps in 103 seconds.

\label{fig:mcm 3d dumbbell}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Anisotropic mean curvature motion}
So far, the motion law considered may be more appropriately stated as isotropic mean curvature motion. In \cite{oberman2011aniso}, Oberman et at., present a method for anisotropic mean curvature flow: 
\begin{align}
        u_t = (\gamma(\omega) + \gamma''(\omega))\abs{\nabla u} \nabla \cdot \left( \frac{\nabla u}{\abs{\nabla u}} \right),
\label{aniso mcm}
\end{align}
where $\omega = \arctan(u_y/u_x)$, and 
\begin{align}
        \gamma(\omega) 
= \gamma_n(\omega) 
= \frac{1}{n^2+1}(n^2 + 1 - \sin(n\omega)), 
\quad\text{for } n = 0,2,4,8.
\label{aniso mcm gamma}
\end{align}
Under isotropic mean curvature motion, a simple, smooth closed contour in 2D has a circular limiting shape as it reduces to a point. Under \cref{aniso mcm,aniso mcm gamma}, the limiting shape will have $n$-fold rotational symmetry.

For our methods, the added factor of $\gamma(\omega) + \gamma''(\omega)$ presents no additional difficulty at all. Again, we can stabilize with $p\Delta u$, with $p=(1+(n^2-1)/(n^2+1))p_0$. Setting $n=4$, and on a periodic grid of size $256\times 256$, we take 500 time steps with a linearly stabilized ETDRK2 to produce the solution presented in \cref{fig:aniso mcm}.

\section{Phase Separation on Moo Surfaces}
For our last batch of experiments, we will define and evolve phase separation models on rectangular grids in 2D, and on surfaces in 3D using the closest point method \cite{ruuth2008simple,macdonald2009implicit}.

\subsection{Cahn-Hilliard on surfaces using the closest point method}
In this section, the model equation is 
\begin{align}
u_t = -\epsilon^2 \Delta_\S^2 u + \Delta_\S(u^3- u),
\label{ch}
\end{align}
where $\epsilon>0$ is a small parameter that determines interfacial thickness, $\S$ is a surface in $\bR^3$, and the solution $u$ indicates the domains of the separating binary fluid.

We assume initially that the solution is well-mixed and thus the initial conditions are chosen uniformly at random from $[-\epsilon,\epsilon]$. As time progress, the initially well-mixed solution aggregates into homogeneous zones separated by transition layers of thickness $\O(\epsilon)$. Within the homogeneous zones, $u$ takes on the value 1 or $-1$. 

To discretize the surface operators, we use the closest point method of Ruuth and Merriman \cite{ruuth2008simple}. Their approach is to extend the solution off the surface into the embedding space at each time step in a way that allows them to replace the surface operators with their Cartesian analogs. It then becomes a matter of selecting from standard finite difference methods for the discretization of the spatial operators. We also mention the work of Macdonald and Ruuth \cite{macdonald2009implicit} that provides for implicit time stepping with the closest point method. See \cite{cpmcodes} for open access closest point method software.

To use a linearly stabilized method for time stepping, we must determine $p$. To determine $p$, we linearize \cref{ch}. Substituting with $u = u^n + \delta v$, we have 
\begin{align}
\begin{split} 
(u^n + \delta v)_t 
&= -\epsilon^2\Delta_\S^2 (u^n + \delta v) 
+ \Delta_\S((u^n + \delta v)^3 - u^n - \delta v) 
\\
&= -\epsilon^2\delta\Delta_\S^2 v
+ \delta^3\Delta_\S v^3 + 3\delta^2u^n \Delta_\S v^2 + 3\delta (u^n)^2 \Delta_\S v - \delta \Delta_\S v. 
\end{split} 
\label{ch linearize}
\end{align}
Differentiating with respect to $\delta$ and then setting $\delta = 0$, we arrive at the linearized equation 
\begin{align}
v_t = -\epsilon^2\Delta_\S^2 v + (3(u^n)^2-1) \Delta_\S v. 
\end{align}
Thus if we are to stabilize with $p\Delta_\S u$, then we may choose $p$ as 
\begin{align}
p \geq (3\bar u^2 - 1)p_0, 
\end{align}
where $\bar u = \sup_\S \abs{u^n}$. For simplicity, we use $p=2p_0$ as $u$ takes values in $[-1,1]$.  

\cref{fig:ch torus,fig:ch cow} show the solution to \cref{ch} on two different surfaces at time $T=100$. In both examples, the spatial grid is uniform, with $h=0.14$ for the torus and $h=0.075$ for the cow. We then set $\epsilon=2h$. Time stepping is done with SBDF2 and for the time step-size, we have chosen $\Delta t = 0.5h$ for the torus and $\Delta t = 1$ for the cow. 

The latter $\Delta t =1$ condition is chosen to emphasize that we may choose the step-size independent of stability concerns. For the Cahn-Hilliard equation, the dynamics may be broadly split into two stages \cite{sun2000dynamics}. The first is a fast coarsening stage in which a pattern of internal layers is formed from the initial state over an $\O(1)$ time interval. This is followed by an exponentially slow coarsening during which the internal layers may collapse together to reach a stable/energy minimizing state. It is during this slow phase that our schemes provide the greatest benefit.

\subsection{A modified Cahn-Hilliard with nonlocal interactions}
For our last example, we solve 
\begin{align}
        u_t = -\epsilon^2 \Delta^2 u + \Delta (u^3 + 3mu^2 - (1-3m^2)u) - u, 
\quad (x,y)\in[-2\pi,2\pi]^2,
\quad t>0,
\label{mch}
\end{align}
with periodic boundary conditions and uniform random perturbations in $[-\epsilon,\epsilon]$ for the initial condition. In this model, $\epsilon>0, m\geq 0$ are parameters that characterize the steady state behaviour of the solution \cite{choksi2009phase,choksi20112d}. As described in \cite{choksi2009phase}, \cref{mch} is of interest for its connections to the self-assembly of diblock copolymers. In model \cref{mch}, different regions in the parameter space $(\epsilon, m)$ dictate the formation of distinct energy-minimizing patterns from an initial well-mixed state. Numerically, one expects difficulties generating these energy-minimizing states. As in the previous example, we consider our methods for handling the exponentially slowing dynamics that take place as the solution inches toward steady state. We will show that our methods are stable and can quickly advance the solution to determine the minimizing states. 

To stabilize \cref{mch}, we first need to estimate the term $\Delta(u^3 + 3mu^2-(1-3m^2)u)$. We proceed as in \cref{ch linearize} to find the linearized form
\begin{align}
v_t = -\epsilon^2\Delta^2 v - v + (3(u^n)^2 + 6mu^n - (1-3m^2) \Delta v.
\end{align}
Thus if we stabilize with $p\Delta u$, choosing $p \geq (2+6m+3m^2)p_0$ will be sufficient to guaranteeing unconditional stability.

\cref{fig:mchp energy minimizers} gives experiments showing that our methods can be used to access the energy-minimizing states of \cref{mch}. As a final note, we mention that we adopt the strategy of spectral filtering that was proposed in \cite{choksi20112d}.
