%   PACKAGES AND CUSTOMIZATIONS  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%   Add any packages or custom commands you need for your thesis here.
%   You don't need to call the following packages, which are already called in
%   the sfuthesis class file:
%
%   - appendix
%   - etoolbox
%   - fontenc
%   - geometry
%   - lmodern
%   - nowidow
%   - setspace
%   - tocloft
%
%   If you call one of the above packages (or one of their dependencies) with
%   options, you may get a "Option clash" LaTeX error. If you get this error,
%   you can fix it by removing your copy of \usepackage and passing the options
%   you need by adding
%
%       \PassOptionsToPackage{<options>}{<package>}
%
%   before \documentclass{sfuthesis}.

\chapter{Introduction}
Prior contributions to this subject: Duchemin and Eggers \cite{duchemin2014explicit}, Smereka \cite{smereka2003semi}. Other methods for handling PDEs of this type.
What are other ways people handle nonlinear stiff equations? 

\chapter{Adding Zero, and a Modified Test Equation}
In this section, it will be important to give exact details as to the type of equations that I am solving. Then starting from a generic equation of this type, we add zero
\begin{align*}
        u_t = \N(u)
= \underbrace{p\L u}_\text{linear} +\underbrace{ (\N(u) - p\L u)}_\text{nonlinear}, 
\quad 
p > 0.
\end{align*}

We ask for stability for all $\Delta t > 0$. What is a parabolic PDE? Elliptic PDE? More on the history, the result of Duchemin and Eggers \cite{duchemin2014explicit}.

\chapter{IMEX Linear Multistep Methods}
Some details are in \cite{ascher1995implicit}.

\chapter{Higher Order with Exponential Time Differencing}
A truly comprehensive review is \cite{hochbruck2010exponential}

\chapter{Numerical Results}
Oh yeah, lots of neat pictures.

\chapter{Conclusion}

%
%   References and appendices. Appendices come after the bibliography and
%   should be in the order that they are referred to in the text.
%
%   If you include figures, etc. in an appendix, be sure to use
%
%       \caption[]{...}
