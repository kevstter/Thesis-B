\chapter{Introduction}
Prior contributions to this subject: Duchemin and Eggers \cite{duchemin2014explicit}, Smereka \cite{smereka2003semi}. Other methods for handling PDEs of this type.
What are other ways people handle nonlinear stiff equations? 

Often, we see new, efficient solvers that are so complex, that the preferred method of choice remains those that are simple, clear, and easy to implement. 

\section{Overview}
An outline of this thesis is as follows: in Chapter 2, we motivate the key ideas through a moderately challenging problem in 1D, setup a framework for analyzing methods to be proposed, and expound on a related piece of work that led to our own research. In Chapter 3, we propose the use of IMEX LMMs in our framework and conduct a stability analysis. Deficiencies exposed in Chapter 3 presented us an opportunity to investigate a class of ETD schemes. These are considered in Chapter 4. Seriously fun applications are all in Chapter 5, and wrapping it all up will be a conclusion. We will recap there what we have learned, and some exciting potential future work.
