\chapter{Higher Order with Exponential Time Differencing}
The investigation with IMEX LMMs left us with a major question. Since the variants derived from SBDF3, SBDF4, admitted bounded parameter ranges and thus proved worthless for practical use, is it possible to construct practical high order linearly stabilize time stepping methods? In this chapter, we answer in the affirmative. To do so, we look to a relatively new class of methods with exceptional stability properties.
