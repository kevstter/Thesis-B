\chapter{Conclusion}
The conclusion is a good place to summarize our findings.

+emphasize that the inversion is of the same operator at each time step
	
+stabilized explicit RK (RKC, ROCK, DUMKA)

\noindent	
Potential work

+A study of the behaviour of the errors from choosing a (sub)optimal parameter, $p$.

+Study of the error constant and its dependence on p on a fully nonlinear problem 

+Cost/benefit analysis of adapting p

+Adaptive time stepping

+Finding linearly stabilized schemes that do well in all three criteria we've set

+simple, efficient high order methods. ones that are easy to apply like sbdf2, cnab; complicated boundary conditions make etdrk difficult
