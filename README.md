# Masters Thesis: Linearly Stabilized Schemes for the Time Integration of Stiff Nonlinear PDEs

## Dive right into it
The file [thesis.pdf](./thesis.pdf) is the latest/final version of the thesis.

Over in the [Research-Codes](https://github.com/kevstter/Research-Codes) repository are MATLAB scripts using the techniques developed in the thesis to solve problems in image inpainting, mean curvature flow, and phase separation.
