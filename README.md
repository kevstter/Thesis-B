# Masters Thesis: Linearly Stabilized Schemes for the Time Integration of Stiff Nonlinear PDEs

## Dive right into it
The file [thesis.pdf](./thesis.pdf) is the latest/final version of the thesis.

Over in the [Research-Codes](https://github.com/kevstter/Research-Codes) repository are MATLAB scripts using the techniques developed in the thesis to solve problems in image inpainting, mean curvature flow, and phase separation.

## Breaking it down for a first reading
For someone who is relatively new to numerical ODEs and PDEs, but is at least familiar with these acronyms, the introduction will cover a number of important definitions and concepts that are fundamental to the development and rationale behind linearly stabilized time stepping schemes. However, it is brief, so further reading from other sources to shore up on the fundamentals may be necessary. It serves best to those who have seen or worked with numerical PDEs at some point in their studies, but need a reminder for those memories to resurface.

Now where to go from here? Well, reading in order wouldn't be such a bad suggestion. Chapter 2 will provide the reader with the most basic version of a linearly stabilized scheme alongside a simple 1D nonlinear stiff PDE. It is from here then that a generalization of the technique is motivated.

In the unlikely case that the reader is already familiar with the existing literature on schemes of this type, the new ideas start in Chapter 3, so one might want to start there, or you may want to jump to Chapter 5, to get a sense of the improvement we are getting by using the new vs. the old methods. It should be mentioned that there are two really interesting numerical examples dissected in Chapter 3.

To be honest, on a first reading, Chapter 4 should be skipped entirely. 

And finally, having familiarized yourself with the old and the new methods, and maybe checked out two or three of the numerical experiments in Chapters 3 and 5, go to the conclusion where everything is rehashed, tied together and explained in plain English without the formulas and technical analysis.

That's what I would recommend for a first reading.
